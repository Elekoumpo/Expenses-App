# expenses-app

This app is created in order to showcase basic concepts of React.js that I've learned so far. 
Whole app is made out of few components and some of them are truly interesting, such as component Chart,
which is used to paint the graph based on users monthly expenses in chosen year.
Conditional content, state management, passing data via props are just some of the concepts used in this app.
